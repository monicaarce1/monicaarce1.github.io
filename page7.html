<h1 style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:60px;">The song gives that vibe where you barely just focus</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:45px;">Things will get better you know</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:125%;">Just imagine yourself sleeping to the beat and drift off to space<br>
  I know that you need to get some sleep. It's a song that gives the vibes of a long day and wanting to relax.<br>
There's not much lyrics to the song but it's more of a instrumental song.
