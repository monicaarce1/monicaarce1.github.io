<br>This song makee you feel happy in a way where it brightens up your day. <br>
The chours of the song makes you feel like you don't care because you're happy<br>
Huh, because I'm happy<br>
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof<br>
Because I'm happy<br>
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth<br>
Because I'm happy<br>
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you<br>
Because I'm happy<br>
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do<br>

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:125%;">We all have a happiness baseline, which is allows a general long-term happiness. We all have good days and not-so-good days, and so our happiness constantly fluctuates around the baseline.<br>
The important thing here is that we always return back to the baseline.</p>
